2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-2#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/interpolation/m_divmult input U_SNN/U_RL/interpolation/m_divmult/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult11 input U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult11/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult13 input U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult13/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult17 input U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult17/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult7 input U_SNN/U_RL/k_mult/mult7/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/spike_train/mult_res input U_SNN/U_RL/spike_train/mult_res/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP U_SNN/U_RL/interpolation/m_divmult multiplier stage U_SNN/U_RL/interpolation/m_divmult/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#2 Warning
